Any ideas for perks go here. They should be realistic
Name: effect
*************************
Cold blooded: lets the player attempt a first-strike skill check for combat
Pack rat: improved carry capacity
Did I say that?: can re-roll charisma checks
Wild Wasteland (needs a different name): random encounters are much more likely
Salty: lets the player sail wind-powered vehicles
Scary: makes there a slight chance that enemies attempt to run away from combat even if they're properly equipped (and didn't bring a kinfe to a gunfight)
Knife to a gunfight: increased chance of surviving (and succeeding) when attempting to rush an enemy equipped with a ranged weapon and getting into melee combat
Speedy: increased movement speed when exploring
Iron gut: risk on all foods reduced 20%
Double damage potion: all damage done will be doubled
Weakness debuff: all damage done will be halved
Rabbies: all damage increased by 1.25, but food eatten will be halved
StoneSkin: all damage decreased by 10% per hour, all food eatten will restore 100 - 10% * number of hours with the effect
CementSocks: speed decreased
