RECURRING CHARACTERS
These are characters who:
-appear in every playthrough
-give quests
-have detailed backstories
They may either appear in specific locations, after completing certain other quests, or randomly.

1. Louie C. (the devil)
Louie is a businessman, and he desses like one- he has a suit that's 3 sizes too big for him, and he's always trying to sell something from his briefcase. He's not always looking for money, and the way he makes deals has some people doubting the quality of his character, despite him never being anything but kind to the people around him. Louie appears at the beginning of the game, offering the players musical instruments that have magical powers like instantly leveling up the players, adding carry weight, etc. The choice to take the instruments or not decides which way the devil questline goes. If people in Nestor see one of our characters talking to Louie, a townsperson will come and talk to the other character, claiming that he is actually Satan.

2. Old Bill the Junk Collector
Bill is an old man, and he's lonely. His wife passed many years ago, and now he's got a large plot of land that his family used to own, a huge pile of junk, and lots of stories to tell. He's a simple man, and he lives a spartan life. Every day, he gets up at 4 a.m. to tend to his animals (he has a dairy cow, a small chicken coop, and a small flock of sheep). Then, regardless of the weather, he sits on a rocking chair on his porch, next to his bloodhound Otis, plays his harmonica, and waits for visitors. If visitors come, he will offer them to stay in his home for the night and let them trade with him. If not, he goes into his shed and works on a project- repairing an old car, painting a sign for a nearby town, or building chairs.
