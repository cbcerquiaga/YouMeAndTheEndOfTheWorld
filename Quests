Part one:





SIDE QUESTS
1. DJ MasterFunc- there is a self-styled DJ who absolutely loves old music, of all kinds. If you find him music, he'll not only pay you, but he'll play it on the radio.
Part one: meeting DJ MasterFunc. He is a fixed encounter at the first music store the player finds, and he is rummaging through crates of old CDs, records, and tapes. The player can talk to him, and has the option to be friendly and take the quest, rude and take the quest, or to rob him (and of course, kill him), though that would end the quest.
Part two: delivering music. Any time music is found, the player can take it to DJ Masterfunc. He'll take working computers and phones, mp3s, CDs, casettes, and vinyls, but he pays more per song and won't pay for repeats

2. The Kegley Cup- there is a wealthy mayor who wants to see a professional ice hockey league inbetween cities, like the good old days. He'll comission you to go around to nearby settlements and encourage them to build better hockey arenas, and assemble pro teams to play the local teams at his settlement. Many settlements are in far too dire of straits in order to afford pro sports, so some settlements may need mini-quests to be done in order to build them up well enough to start a pro hockey team. Once completed, your pay is based on the number of teams you brought into the league, the quality of their arenas, and the quality of the teams- if you encourage a settlement to just send 5 40 year olds to play in the league, he won't pay you much.

3. Mind of Chef- An older woman is looking to compile a cookbook full of the best recipes known to humankind. She would travel herself, but she's far too old. She's already put all of her own recipes into the book, but she wants it to be the best cookbook of all time, so she wants you to help by traveling the wasteland to find the best recipes, and cooking them for her to try. If the recipes you bring aren't good, or if you cook them poorly, she'll be upset and not pay you as much. It's possible to kill her by giving her 2 burnt meals in a row.
