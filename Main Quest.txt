MAIN QUESTLINES
-Instead of one main story, we have several depending on which the players want to play through. They can choose to not do any if they want.
-The players are the main characters but not the protagonists of the plot. This means that it doesn't matter so much who they are and then players can create whoever they want in order to fill in the gaps and role play as much or as little as they want.
-The story needs to be driven by exploring and solving the puzzle, not by following people, fighting, or anything else.
-The story needs to emphasize the theme that people are capable of more together than alone. We need to have puzzles that can only be solved by 2 people, go to places where people are thriving despite the situation because they're working togehter or failing because they're going it alone or turning on one another.
-The story needs to be able to be completed in a number of different ways to make different builds viable.

MAIN QUEST: FIRST AND ONLY
Objective: Find the boy, either take him to his father to be killed or kill his father.

Part one: The Chase
A teenaged boy runs through your town, clearly running away from someone or something. He drops an old book, it's filled with love notes from someone, presumably to him. You find the book, and not long after, a big man comes into town with a posse asking if you've seen the boy. He explains that this boy is his son, and that he's ran away from home and that he's worried aobut him. He mentions that some girl has driven him crazy and that he has run off to be with her, but that this is unacceptable because he has responsibilities at home...that he needs to help farm or their settlement will starve. His tone is one of genuine concern. The village elders offer him provisions because of this, which he gladly accepts before he and his friends head off into the wilderness to find this boy. If you try to get more information about why the boy would run away, the man will respond that he has gone crazy about the girl. The posse are heavily armed, and if you ask about this, the response is that the world is a dangerous place and they want to be safe. 
There is a clue in the book about where he may have gone- there is a bridge that the teens like to go to that they talk about frequently in the book. It is near the early settlement, and requires a puzzle to be solved to get in. Inside, there is a message carved into the wall, empty food packages, a beaten up book of poetry, and evidence that people have been sleeping here. The message on the wall informs the players that it's not safe to stay there and to meet at <riddle location>.

Part two: The Hunt
Upon stepping out of the bridge area, the father and his gang are outside to greet you. They mention the riddle and how they could not solve it, and ask what your intentions are snooping around here. Conversing with them, the father reveals that the girl was betrothed to another man in an arranged marriage, but that the boy and girl ran off together instead.

Part three: The Girl
Following the riddle leads to a hidden location that can only be accessed by a two player puzzle. Getting in, we have our first contact with both the boy and the girl. They are behind a destroyed wall, where the players cannot reach them, but they can converse. Here, details about the story can be heard from his perspective. His perspective paints the father as a leader of a cult that took over a nearby town and that rules it from a compound nearby, and that he is far from poor or starving. The girl does not talk this entire time (she can and does write, but she's lost her voice), but she coughs severely and seems to have an illness caught from the journey. The boy explains that she needs medical attention, but that he cannot be caught in any of the towns close by, even though they have good doctors, because his father has spies there that will get him killed (the real reason for his father's extensive journey). Here, the story starts to branch. You can either:
-convince him it's worth the risk, in which case the two of them will go to the nearest doctor immediately
-convince him that you are on his side and that you'll take her to a doctor, in which case she will receive medical care and he can stay away from watchful eyes
-convince him that his father and his minions followed you here and that they'll be in any moment, and that the two of them need to make an escape someplace farther
-bring medicine, in which case they will profusely thank you and run off into another hiding place

Part four: Doctor
If the players convince the couple to go to the nearest town together, they are caught immediately, at which point they steal medicine and run off into the wilds again.
If the players convince the couple that they are on their side, they can take the girl (who needs to be pulled on a sled/wagon at this point) to the nearest doctor safely, or farther away, in which case she doesn't survive.
If the player convinces them to escape, the girl doesn't survive.
-If the girl survives, then she tells you about their plans and where they're going next, as well as filling in some more information about their town and what happened.
-If she doesn't survive, the next step in the quest is to go back to town and tell her parents.

Part five: Now What?
-If the couple escaped together, you are stuck talking to the father. He is getting increasingly frustrated, and mentions something about how he's going to kill that boy. If one of the players has good enough charisma, they can get him to say that he didn't really mean it, but that the boy is derranged, dangerous, and that they need to bring him home for his own safety and so they can rehabilitate him- otherwise, he'll just say that he wasn't serious. He says that he has no idea where to go from here, no idea where they might have gone.
-If the girl died, then the next part of the quest is to go to their town and tell her parents. 
In either scenario, the next move is to go to the town. Arriving at the town, the gatekeeper will not let you in unless you trick him- you can steal clothes from a nearby guard patrol and disguise your way in, you can bribe the gatekeeper, or you can trick him some way into letting you in (by seduction, guilting him, scaring him, or just lying to him). Coming into the town, you find exactly what the boy described. It appears to be heavily guarded, but asking around, you can figure out which house has the girl's family. From here, you have some choices:
If the girl is alive:
-you can lie and say she died, which they may or may not believe
-you can explain what happened
If the girl is dead:
-you can lie and say she survived, which they may or may not believe
-you can explain what happened
What happened, what you tell them, and whether or not they believe you affects how they react and future interactions, but no matter what, the mother (her father is too sad/stressed/angry depending on what happened to talk to you) tell you that the boy's father, the town's "mayor", had arranged a marriage between one of his supporters and their daughter. The boy killed this man, and also killed his stepmother on the way out of town. She mentions how her daughter always wanted to see the coast, and mentions that they may have gone there...that's across the entire map though, quite a trek. Prodding can get you more information, but not much useful.

Part six: A Journey

Part seven: A Standoff
...

Part ?: The End of the World
The finale comes down to this- the boy (and maybe girl) are holed up safely in someplace that could be destroyed by a lot of people but is pretty much impregnable otherwise, and the father is ready to storm their hiding place and take him, but they can't find a way in. There are several possible endings:
-Robespierre ending: the players convince the townspeople to rise up and kill their oppressors, letting the boy go free
-Moderator ending A: The players convince the boy to come out and face his father, and kills him.
-Moderator ending B: The players convince the boy to come out and face his father, and gets killed by him.
-Frankenstein ending: The players convince the townspeople to kill the boy.
-Mice and Men Ending: The players trick the boy into letting them into his hiding place, at which point they kill him.
-300 ending: The players show the father how to get into the hiding place, at which point he goes in and kills him.
-Tough on Crime Ending: the players convince the leader of a nearby settlement that killing this boy is in their best interest (strategic advantage, he's a menace to society, economic advantage, depends on the settlement), at which point soldiers from that settlement come in, take the boy out and kill him.

Part ?+1: A Resolution

MAIN QUEST: 
Objective: Save the town from being raided by gangsters

Part One: Arrival
This story begins with the players arriving in what appears to be a normal settlement. There are shops, people have set up houses, and it's generally a nicer place to be than the squatting semi-settlements so many people seem to live in. But once the players come in and start walking around, all the settlers start buttoning up the town and hiding. If either player tries to talk to any townsperson, they make it clear that there is no time to talk. Then, a gang rolls into town. They don't notice you, but they find and beat a single straggler, and old man, and head for the center of town where the townspeople have set up an offering for them- a hefty amount of goods both farmed and scavenged. The gangsters don't notice the players and leave town. Talking to the townspeople, the players can learn that this has been going on for years, and that this year's harvest was poor and delivering enough grain for the offering will mean that people in town will starve. They plead with you to go to the next town over to get them food.

Part Two: Seaside
Heading to the next town, the players meet the mayor, and can make one of the following deals:
-the town takes out a loan to pay for the food
-the mayor gives them food out of kindness but only this once
-the mayro will let some of the other townspeople come and sharecrop their land
-the players aggrivate the mayor and don't get anything
The mayor knows about hwat is happening the next town over, but doesn't want to intervene directly because of how powerful that gang is. On your way out of town, there is a standoff- a local merchant and one of the gangsters from the next town. It turns out that the gang was actually hired by the merchant to help him get a monopoly in that town so his rival couldn't. The merchant is mad that the gangsters are causing too much havoc and so the people are too poor to buy his goods. As they fight, they tumble into a bar, where local tough guy <NAME> stares them down and they both leave.

Part Three: Help
The townspeople desperately ask for help as their condition gets worse

Part Four: Convince Somebody
In order to help, the players have to pick a way to accomplish that:
-convince the townspeople to run away and hope that the gang won't go after them
-convincethe townspeople to try and fight the gang
-convince the gangsters to leave the people alone
-convince somebody to stop the gangsters
-convince the rival merchant to go after the one you saw in town
Alternatively, the players can choose to make things worse:
-convince the gang that they could get more stuff by not doing what the merchant told them to do

Part Five: Assistance
Depending on the players' choice, they have to try and help whoever they chose to deal with

Part Six: Climax

Part Seven: Resolution
