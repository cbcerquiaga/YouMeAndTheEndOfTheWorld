MAIN QUESTLINE
-The players are the main characters but not the protagonists of the main plot. This means that it doesn't matter so much who they are and then players can create whoever they want in order to fill in the gaps and role play as much or as little as they want.
-The main story  needs to be driven by exploring and solving the puzzle, not by following people, fighting, or anything else.
-The story needs to emphasize the theme that people are capable of more together than alone. We need to have puzzles that can only be solved by 2 people, go to places where people are thriving despite the situation because they're working togehter or failing because they're going it alone or turning on one another.
-The story needs to be able to be completed in a number of different ways to make different builds viable.

Main objective: Find the boy, either take him to his father to be killed or kill his father.

Part one: The Chase
A teenaged boy runs through your town, clearly running away from someone or something. He drops an old book, it's filled with love notes from someone, presumably to him. You find the book, and not long after, a big man comes into town with a posse asking if you've seen the boy. He explains that this boy is his son, but that he's derranged, dangerous, and that they need to bring him home for his own safety and so they can rehabilitate him. He mentions that some girl has driven him crazy and that he has run off to be with her, but that this is unacceptable because he has responsibilities at home...that he needs to help farm or their settlement will starve. Despite this scathing description, his tone is one of genuine concern. The village elders offer him provisions because of this, which he gladly accepts before he and his friends head off into the wilderness to find this boy. Once they leave, the elders reveal that they were so moved
There is a clue in the book about where he may have gone- there is a bridge that the teens like to go to that they talk about frequently in the book. It is near the early settlement, and requires a puzzle to be solved to get in. Inside, there is a message carved into the wall, empty food packages, a beaten up book of poetry, and evidence that people have been sleeping here. The message on the wall informs the players that it's not safe to stay there and to meet at <riddle location>.

Part two: The Hunt
Upon stepping out of the bridge area, the father and his gang are outside to greet you. They mention the riddle and how they could not solve it, and ask what your intentions are snooping around here. Conversing with them, the father reveals that the girl was betrothed to another man in an arranged marriage, and the boy killed this man and also killed the father's wife, his stepmother. Having levelled up certain speech skills can help get more information out of him, and much of it paints both the boy and the girl in terrible lights.

Part three: The Girl
Following the riddle leads to a hidden location that can only be accessed by a two player puzzle. Getting in, we have our first contact with both the boy and the girl. They are behind a destroyed wall, where the players cannot reach them, but they can converse. Here, details about the story can be heard from his perspective. His perspective paints the father as a leader of a cult that took over a nearby town and that rules it from a compound nearby, and that he is far from poor or starving. The girl does not talk this entire time (she can and does write, but she's lost her voice), but she coughs severely and seems to have an illness caught from the journey. The boy explains that she needs medical attention, but that he cannot be caught in any of the towns close by, even though they have good doctors, because his father has spies there that will get him killed (the real reason for his father's extensive journey). Here, the story starts to branch. You can either:
-convince him it's worth the risk, in which case the two of them will go to the nearest doctor immediately
-convince him that you are on his side and that you'll take her to a doctor, in which case she will receive medical care and he can stay away from watchful eyes
-convince him that his father and his minions followed you here and that they'll be in any moment, and that the two of them need to make an escape someplace farther

Part four: Doctor
If the players convince the couple to go to the nearest town together, they are caught immediately, at which point they steal medicine and run off into the wilds again.
If the players convince the couple that they are on their side, they can take the girl (who needs to be pulled on a sled/wagon at this point) to the nearest doctor safely, or farther away, in which case she doesn't survive.
If the player convince them to escape, the girl doesn't survive.
-If the girl survives, then she tells you about their plans and where they're going next, as well as filling in some more information about their town and what happened.
-If she doesn't survive, the next step in the quest is to go back to town and tell her parents.

Part five: Now What?
...

Part six: A standoff
...

Part seven: The end of the world
The finale comes down to this- the boy (and maybe girl) are holed up safely in someplace that could be destroyed by a lot of people but is pretty much impregnable otherwise, and the father is ready to storm their hiding place and take him, but they can't find a way in. There are several possible endings:
-Yojimbo ending: find the mysterious stranger in a tavern across the map, convince him to liberate this town from the cult. He comes in, kills the father and all of his followers with ease, and the game is settled
-Rambo ending: Same as the yojimbo ending, but the players take matters into their own hands.
-Robespierre ending: the players convince the townspeople to rise up and kill their oppressors, letting the boy go free
-Moderator ending A: The players convince the boy to come out and face his father, and kills him.
-Moderator ending B: The players convince the boy to come out and face his father, and gets killed by him.
-Frankenstein ending: The players convince the townspeople to kill the boy.
-Mice and Men Ending: The players trick the boy into letting them into his hiding place, at which point they kill him.
-300 ending: The players show the father how to get into the hiding place, at which point he goes in and kills him.
-Tough on Crime Ending: the players convince the leader of a settlement that killing this boy is in their best interest (strategic advantage, he's a menace to society, economic advantage, depends on the settlement), at which point soldiers from that settlement come in, take the boy out and kill him.
