LOCATIONS

PERMANENT LOCATIONS- in the same place and exaclty the same every playthrough
1. Shipwright high- a highschool-turned settlement where the people sustain themselves from the sea. They buld boats to sell to others, and they fish. They do relatively well, with much of their land being suitable for farming, and plenty of buildings for living space. Previously, the school was nowhere near water, but sea levels have risen.
2. Downtown- full of dilapidated buildings, with some overgrown and some flooded streets. Many people still squat here, but with nowhere to farm and not much to loot, it's not much of a life.
3. The suburbs- formerly nice houses ruined by the megastorms that came with the climate change after the asteroid struck
4. Petrolia- a city built around controlling and refining oil. They are relatively warlike, constantly trying to conquer nearby gas stations to control more gasoline. They also havea a large oil refinery and many oil wells.
5. The Bottling Plant- formerly a bottling plant for a major company, now it's just a husk to be looted that some squatters and raiders live in.
6. The Aquarium- the wealthiest settlement. They have figured out how to breed fish for farming, and have an effectively unlimited supply of food because of it, as well as a huge area that they have built up into a small town. They trade with Petrolia, mostly food for oil, since petrolia needs food and The Aquarium needs oil for electricity.


MOVING LOCATIONS- locations that are the same every time the game is played, but change positions on the map
1. Initial spawn homestead
2. The HOA settlement- after society collapsed, a wealthy neighborhood called <name> . They're still relatively wealthy because what was once a golf course is now excellent farmland, and the people there are the descendents of people who were wealthy before.
3. The Frat Cult- a frathouse and nearby sorority house that will attempt to initiate you
4. Blue Hood- what was previously a terrible neighborhood hasn't changed much, and so it's relatively nice now. When things went bad, nobody thought to loot the people who were already poor. They already had a community garden, and it just needed to be expanded into everyone's yards.
5. Red Hood- just like the Blue Hood, but they hate each other.
6. Raccoon's Treasure- there is a raccoon who, if you follow it, leads you to a giant load of treasure. There is no indication or hint that the players should do this, and killing the raccoon makes the entrance to the treasure seal permanently.
7. "Captain" Crow's Lair- the lair of the notorious "land pirate" who terrorizes the nearby town of Peachtree. It is actually a pirate themed restaurant, based off of the real life Dante's Down the Hatch that was destroyed a few years ago.
8. Peachtree- a relatively successful settlement near downtown that has built levies to keep flood water away from their homes and their farmland (originally a park)
9. The First Team- a burger joint that for some reason never dtopped doing business, even though the rest of the world fell apart. People live nearby, and they make their living by trading with travelers who come through and buy their food.
10.

DYNAMIC LOCATIONS- locations that stay in the same place on the map, but are different each playthrough
1. The mall- could be filled with squatters, a standard settlement, uninhabited, or full of neonazis
2. The airport-could be a highly successful settlement, a refuge for high-level creatures, or taken over by army remnants
3. Zoo- could be full of wild and/or mutated animals, could have a regular settlement there that farms those animals, or a hippie collective
4. University- could be taken over by druggie gangs, communists, or a group that transformed into knowledge-seeking monks.


COMMON LOCATIONS- recurring types of places that the player might encounter. Maybe we can have them be slightly different each time?
1. Gas station
2. House
3. Prepper House- often full of hostile sons-of-preppers
4. Big Box Store (Walmart, but we can't call it that. A fun brand name would be cool)
5. Hardware Store
6. Grocery Store
7. Restaurant
8. Church
9. bank
