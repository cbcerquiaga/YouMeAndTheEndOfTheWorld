LOCATIONS

PERMANENT LOCATIONS- in the same place and exaclty the same every playthrough
1. Shipwright high- a highschool-turned settlement where the people sustain themselves from the sea. They buld boats to sell to others, and they fish. They do relatively well, with much of their land being suitable for farming, and plenty of buildings for living space. Previously, the school was nowhere near water, but sea levels have risen.
2. Downtown- full of dilapidated buildings, with some overgrown and some flooded streets. Many people still squat here, but with nowhere to farm and not much to loot, it's not much of a life.
3. The suburbs- formerly nice houses ruined by the megastorms that came with the climate change after the asteroid struck


MOVING LOCATIONS- locations that are the same every time the game is played, but change positions on the map
1. Initial spawn homestead
2. The HOA settlement- after society collapsed, a wealthy neighborhood called <name> . They're still relatively wealthy because what was once a golf course is now excellent farmland, and the people there are the descendents of people who were wealthy before.
3. The Frat Cult- a frathouse and nearby sorority house that will attempt to initiate you
4. Blue Hood- what was previously a terrible neighborhood hasn't changed much, and so it's relatively nice now. When things went bad, nobody thought to loot the people who were already poor. They already had a community garden, and it just needed to be expanded into everyone's yards.
5. Red Hood- just like the Blue Hood, but they hate each other.
6. Raccoon's Treasure- there is a raccoon who, if you follow it, leads you to a giant load of treasure. There is no indication or hint that the players should do this, and killing the raccoon makes the entrance to the treasure seal permanently.
7.

DYNAMIC LOCATIONS- locations that stay in the same place on the map, but are different each playthrough
1. The mall- could be filled with squatters, a standard settlement, uninhabited, or full of neonazis
2. The airport-could be a highly successful settlement, a refuge for high-level creatures, or taken over by army remnants
3. Zoo- could be full of wild and/or mutated animals, could have a regular settlement there that farms those animals, or a hippie collective
4. University- could be taken over by druggie gangs, communists, or a group that transformed into knowledge-seeking monks.


COMMON LOCATIONS- recurring types of places that the player might encounter. Maybe we can have them be slightly different each time?
1. Gas station
2. House
3. Prepper House- often full of hostile sons-of-preppers
4. Big Box Store (Walmart, but we can't call it that. A fun brand name would be cool)
5. Hardware Store
6. Grocery Store
7. Restaurant
8. Church
9. bank
